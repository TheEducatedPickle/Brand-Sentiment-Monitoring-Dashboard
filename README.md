# Social Impact Monitoring Dashboard
This dashboard uses Watson sentiment analysis to search social media for keywords and employ sentiment analysis on those posts/tweets. Practical applications include measuring brand recognition and evaluating the effectiveness of programs without the typical polarizing views that are expressed in surveys and reviews. This project is currently integrated with Reddit and Twitter.

Built using React.js, Express, and Watson
